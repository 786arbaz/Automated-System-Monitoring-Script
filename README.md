# System Monitoring Script

## Overview

This Bash script is designed for basic system monitoring. It continuously checks and displays key system parameters, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network connectivity.

## Features

- **CPU Usage:** Monitors the current CPU usage percentage.
- **Memory Usage:** Displays the used memory in megabytes.
- **Disk Space Usage:** Shows the percentage of disk space used on the root file system.
- **Network Connectivity:** Checks if the system is connected to the network.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/system-monitor-script.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the script directory:

   ```bash
   cd system-monitor-script
   ```

3. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x system_check.sh
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./system_check.sh
   ```

   The script will continuously monitor and display system parameters with a 5-second interval between each check.
